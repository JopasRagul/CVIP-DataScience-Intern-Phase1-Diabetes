# CVIP-DataScience-Intern-Phase1-Diabetes
😷 Diabeties Diagnosis: Phase 1(Golden Task)  Completed 📊


Task Done:


1 ---> Imported necessary libraries like numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn.

2----> Diabetes dataset is been read has an csv file.

3----> To display the bottom five rows and num of rows and columns 

4----> Getting various summary statistics There is notably a large difference between 99% and max values of predictors “Insulin”,”SkinThickness”,”DiabetesPedigreeFunction”  There are extreme values-Outliers in our data set.

5----> Target variable categorical and value count of Outcome.

6----> Plottings like Exploring the target variable,heatmap for correlation and see how the data is distributed.

7----> prediction usig algorithms like  Logistic regression, RandomForestClassifie, KNeighborsClassifier, Support Vector Classifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, LGBMClassifier, XGBClassifier.

8----> prediction and classifier scores and plot of accuracy score.
